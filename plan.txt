Event Platform: UX Flow & Technical Specification (Gmail API Edition)

Part 1: The Automation Strategy (Gmail API)

Since this MVP utilizes the Gmail API rather than a transactional email service (like SendGrid), the architecture relies on a "Central Relay" model.

The "Central Relay" Concept

Instead of asking every Organizer to log in with their own Google account (which is complex and invasive), the platform uses one master Gmail account (e.g., notifications@your-mvp-app.com) to send all emails.

To ensure the Partners know who they are talking to, we use the Reply-To Protocol.

The Sender: Every email comes technically from notifications@your-mvp-app.com.

The Reply-Path: We programmatically set the Reply-To header to the Organizer's Email (e.g., organizer@gmail.com).

The Result: When the Partner clicks "Reply" in their inbox, the email address automatically switches to the Organizer's address. The Partner never needs to know the system sent it.

The Authentication Mechanism (OAuth2)

We do not use passwords. We use OAuth2 Tokens.

Refresh Token (The Key): Your backend server holds a permanent "Refresh Token." This proves to Google that you own the master Gmail account.

Access Token (The Pass): When a user clicks "Send," the server swaps the Refresh Token for a temporary Access Token valid for 1 hour.

Execution: The server uses this temporary token to fire the emails via the Gmail API.

Part 2: Complete UX Flow (Updated with System Logic)

1. LANDING PAGE

Purpose: Explain the platform + drive signups

Sections:

Hero: "Automate Your Event Planning in Minutes"

How it works (3 steps): Sign up → Fill form → Get offers

Benefits: Save time, compare offers, automated outreach

CTA buttons: "I'm an Organizer" / "I'm a Partner"

2. REGISTRATION FLOW

2A. Choose Account Type

Page: Registration type selection

Two cards: "Register as Organizer" / "Register as Partner"

2B. Organizer Registration Form

Fields: Name, Email, Phone, Password.

System Action: Create User ID in database.

2C. Partner Registration Form

Fields: Company Name, Service Type (Venue, Catering, etc.), City, Contact Name, Contact Email.

System Action: Store partner data indexed by City and Service Type for fast retrieval later.

3. ORGANIZER DASHBOARD

Header: "Welcome, [Name]"

Button: "+ Create New Event Request"

List: Previous requests with status.

4. EVENT REQUEST FORM (Multi-step)

STEP 1: Event Basics

Fields: Event Name, Type, Attendees, Date, Budget.

STEP 2: Venue

Action: User selects City.

Display: List of Venues in that City.

Selection: Checkbox logic.

STEP 3: Catering

Logic: Yes/No.

Display: List of Catering companies in selected City.

STEP 4: Merchandise (CRITICAL TECH STEP)

Header: "Do you need merchandise?"

Logic:

IF Yes: Display Merchandise/Printing companies.

THEN: Show File Upload Section.

The File Upload Process:

User Action: Drags & Drop file (Logo.png).

System Action (Background): The browser uploads the file immediately to Cloud Storage (Firebase Storage/AWS S3).

System Action: The Cloud Provider returns a public Download URL (e.g., https://storage.googleapis.com/.../logo.png).

Data Storage: The App saves this URL to the "Event Request" object in the database.

Why? The Gmail API cannot "hold" a file from a browser form. It needs to fetch the file from a URL or server buffer to attach it.

STEP 5: Sponsors

Logic: Yes/No selection of Sponsor partners.

STEP 6: Additional Details

Field: Additional Notes (textarea).

Button: "Review & Send"

5. REVIEW PAGE

Summary: Shows Event Details, Selected Partners, and Uploaded Files.

Email Preview: Shows the AI-template with placeholders.

Button: "Send All Emails"

6. CONFIRMATION PAGE (The Backend Trigger)

User Action: User clicks "Send All Emails".

System Backend Logic (The "Magic" Step):

Authentication: Server wakes up and requests a fresh Access Token from Google using the stored Refresh Token.

Iterator: Server loops through the list of selected partners.

Construction: For each partner, it builds an email using Nodemailer:

From: Master Account (notifications@app.com)

To: Partner Email

Reply-To: Current Organizer's Email

Subject: "Inquiry: [Event Name]"

Attachment Handling:

If the partner is "Merchandise", the server fetches the file from the Cloud Storage URL and attaches it as a binary stream to the email.

Transmission: The Server sends the packet to https://www.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages/send.

Response: Gmail API returns 200 OK and a messageId.

UI Result:

Header: "Your requests have been sent! ✓"

List:

✉️ Grand Hotel Sofia - Sent

✉️ PrintPro Merchandise - Sent (with 2 files)

7. REQUEST STATUS DASHBOARD

Display: Shows contacted partners.

Note: Because we are using Gmail API, we can technically track if the email was sent, but tracking Opens (Read Receipts) is harder without a paid pixel-tracking service. For MVP, status defaults to "Sent".

8. PARTNER DASHBOARD (Receiver View)

Email Inbox: Partner receives an actual email.

Platform Dashboard: If the partner logs into your app, they see the inquiry there too.

Part 3: Technical Constraints & Guardrails

To ensure this MVP works using Gmail API, the following rules apply:

1. The 500 Daily Limit

Constraint: A standard @gmail.com account can only send 500 emails per rolling 24-hour period.

Impact: If you have 100 users sending 6 requests each, the system will crash.

Solution: Monitor usage. If you approach 400, stop sending and alert the admin. Upgrade to Google Workspace (Business) to increase this limit to 2,000/day.

2. File Size Limits

Constraint: Gmail API has a total message size limit of 25MB.

Impact: If a user uploads three 10MB PDFs, the email will fail to send.

Guardrail: Limit file uploads in the Frontend (Step 4) to 5MB per file and a maximum of 3 files.

3. Security (Tokens)

Constraint: The OAuth2 "Refresh Token" allows anyone to send emails as your app.

Security: This token must exist ONLY in your backend server environment variables (.env). It must never be visible in the frontend React/HTML code.
